![CSV Template](./CSVTemplate.png)

The only two fields that are mandatory are `email` and `subject`, rest all are custom fields and can be replaced with one of your own. The `attachment` fields are obviously optional.

### Compose your email template

    Hi <name>,

    Here you go: <content>

    Regards,
    HR Team.

You can even use HTML to format your content template.

### Let mail unmerge take control!

    mail-unmerge ./header.csv ./content-template.txt

It will send out individual emails to all the email addresses listed in the CSV file, with personalized attachments.
